This repository documents the development of a production-ready MLOps pipeline for forecasting day-ahead wholesale electricity prices in the German market. The goal of this project is to build a complete, automated system that demonstrates practical skills in MLOps and cloud engineering, moving beyond academic concepts to a deployable solution.

**Note:** This is an active project currently in its initial development phase. The features and architecture described below represent the final goal of the 8-week development sprint.

## 🎯 The Business Problem

The volatility of electricity prices is a major challenge for energy traders, grid operators, and industrial consumers. Accurate short-term price forecasting is critical for optimizing energy consumption, managing costs, and making strategic resource allocation decisions. This project will address this real-world need by building an automated system to predict future prices.

The data is sourced from **SMARD.de**, the official market data platform of the German Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur), ensuring relevance and credibility within the German market.

## 🔧 Planned Technical Architecture

The planned architecture is designed for automation, reproducibility, and scalability, incorporating modern MLOps best practices.

**Target Tech Stack:**

* **Language & Libraries**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
* **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow
* **Containerization**: Docker
* **CI/CT Automation**: GitHub Actions
* **API Development**: FastAPI
* **Cloud Platform**: Microsoft Azure (App Service, Container Registry)

### Planned MLOps Features

* **📊 Experiment Tracking**: All model training runs **will be logged** with **MLflow**, capturing code versions, parameters, and metrics for full auditability.
* **📦 Reproducibility**: The entire application **will be containerized** with **Docker** to guarantee a consistent environment for training and deployment.
* **⚙️ Automation (CI/CT)**: A **GitHub Actions** workflow **will be implemented** to automate code quality checks (CI) and schedule weekly model retraining (CT).
* **☁️ Cloud Deployment**: The final model **will be served** via a **FastAPI** REST API, deployed as a Docker container on **Microsoft Azure App Service**.

## 🛠️ Setup (Work in Progress)

As the project is in its initial phase, the primary setup involves cloning the repository and creating a local Python environment. Instructions will be updated as key milestones (like Dockerization) are completed.

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
